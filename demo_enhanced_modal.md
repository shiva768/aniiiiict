## Example Data Flow

1. User opens DetailModal
2. ViewModel calls AnimeDetailRepository
3. Repository fetches from Annict (WorkDetail query)
4. Repository fetches from MyAnimeList (if MAL ID available)
5. Data is transformed and combined
6. UI displays comprehensive information in tabbed layout
7. Users can switch between Episodes and Details tabs
8. External links open in browser via Custom Tabs

This implementation significantly enhances the user experience by providing comprehensive anime information while maintaining all original functionality.
